#This code is an edited version of an example referenced from
#(https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.numfys.net/media/notebooks/planetary_motion_three_body_problem.ipynb), which discussed different constant step size ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers (such as Forward Euler, Explicit Trapezoid, Midpoint Rule and fourth order Runge-Kutta) applied on a two dimensional one body problem. In this example we will use an adaptive step size ODE solver (Embedded Runge-Kutta pair) to solve two and three body problems. A brief motivation for the adaptive step size is explained in [Adaptive Runge-Kutta Methods](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.numfys.net/media/notebooks/adaptive_runge_kutta_methods.ipynb).

# ### Equations of motion
# 
# The gravitational pull between two objects is under classical conditions given by Newton's law of gravitation,
# 
# $$
# \vec{F}_{21}(t)=\vec{F}_{12}(t) = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{{\vec{r_{12}}(t)}^3}\vec r_{12},
# $$
# 
# where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, $r$ is the distance between them and $G\approx 6.67\times 10^{-11} \,\text{m}^3/ \text{kg}\,\text{s}^2$ is the gravitational constant. Newton's  law holds if it is assumed that the masses of the objects are isotropically distributed.
# 
# Consider a three body problem with three objects given by masses $m_1$, $m_2$ and $m_3$. By the principle of superposition, the gravitational pull on an object will be the sum of the gravitational pull of all the other objects $F_1 = F_{12} + F_{13}$. Thus, the equations of motion (EoM) of say $m_1$ is given by
# 
# $$
# \ddot{\vec{r}}_1(t) = -\frac{Gm_2}{\left[\vec{r}_{2}(t)-\vec{r}_{1}(t)\right]^3}\left[\vec{r}_{2}(t)-\vec{r}_{1}(t)\right]-\frac{Gm_3}{\left[\vec{r}_{3}(t)-\vec{r}_{1}(t)\right]^3}\left[\vec{r}_{3}(t)-\vec{r}_{1}(t)\right],
# $$
# 
# $$
# \dot{\vec{r}}_1(t)=\vec{v}_1.
# $$
# 
# The EoM in this problem is a set of ODEs. By giving two initial conditions, e.g. the starting velocity and position, we can reduce the problem to two ODEs, where the next step of the first ODE depends on the previous step of the second ODE. The right hand side (RHS) of the EoM can be described by the following function:

# In[2]:


def RHS(t, y):
    """Calculate the RHS of the EoM, as described above.

        y: array. Vector of length 12 holding the current position and velocity of the three objects

# ### Embedded Runge-Kutta pair
# 
# We now implement the embedded Runge-Kutta pair (often called an adaptive Runge-Kutta method) to solve the EoM. In short, it is a scheme that uses two different Runge-Kutta methods of different order to get an estimate of the local truncation error. Thus, it is possible to more or less decide what accuracy we want the solution to have by adjusting the step size for each iteration. Another advantage of the adaptive step size method is that we achieve better accuracy where it is needed and lower accuracy where it is not (an example will follow). However, these methods may become more computationally demanding, and hence won't improve our implementation in every case.
# 
# The implementation can also be done with a constant step size method, which is done in the animation section below.
# 
# We are going to use the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg order 4 / order 5 embedded pair (RKF45) as described in [Adaptive Runge-Kutta Methods](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.numfys.net/media/notebooks/adaptive_runge_kutta_methods.ipynb):
